# Algorithms for Answering Top-K query

This project implements five algorithms for answering top-k query
BruteForce.cpp (brute force algorithm)
FA.cpp (FA algorithm)
TA.cpp (TA algorithm)
BPA.cpp (BPA algorithm)
BPA2.cpp (BPA2 algorithm)

This project also compares the performance of five algorithms on both independent and correleated datasets





To run the code:

Type <make> in the terminal.
It will automatically compile all the source code and write the results to three files (result1, result2, result3)

It also creates a user test execution file.
It allows users to define their own data set and show the result
